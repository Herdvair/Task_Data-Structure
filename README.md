# Task_Data-Structure
This project was part of the Data Science Bootcamp assignment of "Dibimbing.id", focusing on data structure management and analysis.

## Key Features & Analysis:

- Data Type Exploration: Conducted data type analysis and categorization (continuous and categorical) from the titanic.xlsx dataset, followed by relevant visualization.
- Data Analysis with Looping:
    - Used a for loop to identify the minimum and maximum passenger fares (fares) at each cruise port.
    - Used a while loop to identify passengers over 36 years old.
- Lambda Function Implementation: Applied lambda functions to numeric and categorical data, along with a description of the insights gained from the implementation.
